# ash_stan
A Git repo for ash using STAN

Includes STAN HMC method + Stochastic MAP method estimation of ash 

The primary goal is to make the ash method more flexible for very large data and to incorporate a full bayes model for the mixture proportions.

We shall also focus on glm_ash:  which is a generalized linear model version of ash

We shall also try to implement Black Box Variational Inference.
